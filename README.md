# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console 

In this project, we will be developing a command-line interpreter for an 
Airbnb clone. This interpreter will manage various objects, such as `User`,
`State`, `City`, and `Place`, allowing us to interact with and manipulate data
without a graphical interface.

Key functionalities of the interpreter include:

- **Creating new objects** (e.g., creating a new `User` or `Place`)
- **Retrieving objects** from storage (such as files or databases)
- **Performing operations** on objects (e.g., counting instances or computing 
statistics)
- **Updating object attributes** 
- **Destroying objects**

The `Cmd` class will serve as the foundation for our command interpreter, 
providing a framework for line-oriented command processing. This approach is 
ideal for building test harnesses, administrative tools, and prototypes that 
may eventually evolve into more complex applications.

For this project, I will be creating a Python package by organizing code into 
modules, setting up an `__init__.py` file. I'll use the `cmd` module to build
a command-line interface, allowing for user interaction and command processing.
To ensure code reliability and maintainability, I'll implement unit tests using
the `unittest` framework, particularly important for scaling the project. I'll 
serialize and deserialize objects to JSON for efficient data storage and retrieval. 
Additionally, I'll read and write JSON files using the `json` module to manage
structured data. Date and time operations will be handled with the `datetime` 
module, and I'll generate unique identifiers for entities with `uuid` to ensure 
data uniqueness. Finally, I'll use `*args` and `**kwargs` in function definitions 
to allow flexibility with arguments, making the code adaptable and readable.
