HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web
pages, using elements (tags) and attributes to structure content. A markup
language like HTML organizes data for display, while CSS (Cascading Style 
Sheets) styles the content, controlling layout, colors, and fonts. Browsers 
load web pages by requesting HTML, parsing it into the DOM (Document Object
Model), applying CSS, and executing JavaScript for interactivity. CSS styles 
can be added inline, internally, or via external files, using selectors (e.g.,
 elements, classes, or IDs) to target HTML elements. Specificity values 
determine which styles are applied when conflicts arise. CSS's box model 
defines an element's layout via content, padding, borders, and margins. 
Together, HTML and CSS enable structured, visually appealing, and interactive 
web pages.
